# Credit-Approval-Optimization-System-Using-RL
A Deep Q-Learning Agent that learns optimal credit approval policies by interacting with borrower data, optimizing profits while minimizing defaults.

## Problem Statement

Traditional credit scoring systems rely on static models with fixed assumptions. This project reframes credit risk assessment as a **sequential decision-making problem**, where an agent learns **optimal approval policies** based on past borrower behaviors and repayment patterns.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **PyTorch** (for DQN implementation)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** (for preprocessing, metrics)
- **Streamlit** (for interactive dashboard)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for reward curves, EDA)
